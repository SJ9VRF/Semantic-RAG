# Advanced RAG for Semi-structured Data

This repository contains an implementation of an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, designed to handle and process semi-structured data extracted from PDF documents. It utilizes state-of-the-art NLP techniques along with custom preprocessing pipelines to parse, classify, and effectively retrieve content.

## Features

- **PDF Parsing**: Leverages the `unstructured` library to extract diverse elements such as text, tables, and images.
- **Data Processing**: Processes extracted elements for optimal formatting and utility.
- **Element Classification**: Classifies elements to aid in further processing and retrieval tasks.
- **Content Summarization**: Utilizes advanced NLP models for summarizing extracted content.
- **Content Retrieval**: Employs a multi-vector retrieval system for efficient and relevant content fetching based on user queries.
- **Storage Management**: Manages storage and retrieval of processed and raw data efficiently.
